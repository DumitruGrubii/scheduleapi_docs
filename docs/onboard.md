## Installation

Good news! You don't have to install anything! We will call your backend using REST calls, and you are free to choose any backend stack you prefer.

## Preparation

For security concerns, we ask you to verify the header of requests that come to your REST endpoint.

More can be found in the [security documentation](security).
