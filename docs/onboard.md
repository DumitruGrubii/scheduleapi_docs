## Installation ⏳

Good news! You don't have to install anything! We will call your backend using REST calls, and you are free to choose any backend stack you prefer. 
One simple line of code can streamline the logic of data fetching in your project 🔥

## Preparation 🗂️

For security concerns, we ask you to verify the header of requests that come to your REST endpoint.

More can be found in the [security documentation](security).

## Getting started 🚀

1. **Sign up**

Before you can start creating your tasks, login with one of your social accounts (Google, GitHub or Microsoft) and click on **Workspaces**. Once there you can then personalize your project by giving it a name and a URL address or more than one if needed. 

2. **Manage your Workspaces**

Now that you have an active project you can create a **task**. Each task represents a request that can have many schedules. We support 5 HTTP methods and they are: 

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE
* PATCH
